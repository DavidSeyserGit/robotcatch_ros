# RobotCatch ROS

This repository contains the ROS implementation of the Robot Catch project. It focuses on teaching robots to catch balls using Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Overview

The Robot Catch project provides a framework for robotic ball catching through RL algorithms. This ROS package integrates perception, decision-making, and control components needed for successful ball interception.

## Features

- Ball detection and tracking in real-time
- Reinforcement Learning for catch trajectory optimization
- Integration with ROS ecosystem
- Digital Twin

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotcatch_ros.git

# Navigate to the workspace
cd robotcatch_ros

# Build the package
colcon build
```

## Usage

```bash
# Source the workspace
source devel/setup.bash

# Launch the main application
ros2 launch robotcatch_robotinterface robot_bingup.py
```

This will launch RViz with the Robot and also the EGM Interface
## Dependencies

- ROS2
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Gym or similar RL environments
